                <p className = 'text-[20px] text-white text-center p-[10px]'>Compilation is the process by which we turn your model diagram into a real, functional Keras model. Exciting, right?</p>
                <p className = 'text-[20px] text-white text-center p-[10px]'>Unfortunately, because of our limited computational resources, we can't train your model through the website version. You'll have to get the Desktop version for that.</p>
                <p className = 'text-[20px] text-white text-center p-[10px]'>Instead, we will send the compiled model in a .keras file to your computer, where you can train your data on it. You'll have to accept downloads from us for that to happen, of course.</p>
                <p className = 'text-[20px] text-white text-center p-[10px]'>While this does mean that you'll have to code to use the model, we hope that we've provided a foundation for you to get started!</p>
                <p className = 'text-[20px] text-white text-center p-[75px]'>One final note: We do not keep <i>any</i> of your data. The moment you receive your model, we delete it from our systems. We know you're serious about privacy, so we're serious about keeping it.</p>
