            <li>Dense layers are the fundamental building blocks of modern machine learning models.</li>
            <li>At their core, their job is to turn an input vector with 'F' features into an output vector with 'U' units. They do this by computing a weighted sum of all input features for every unit.</li>
            <li className = 'pb-2'>This GIF by <Link href = 'https://pub.aimind.so/convolutional-neural-networks-cnns-for-image-recognition-2d584775205b'>Sunghyun An</Link> does a good job of showing this aspect.

            </li>
            <li>Because every input feature is weighed into every output unit, they were given the name 'fully-connected' or 'dense'.</li>
            <hr className = 'w-4/5 rounded-2xl border-black border-1 m-5' />
            <li>You should note that a different set of weights is used for every unit and that that each one of these weights are trainable. You can probably see how this can very quickly lead to a large training load</li>
            <li>At the same time, this allows them to learn a lot of complex relationships between features. In fact, given enough time and data, dense layers are theoretically capable of learning <Link href = 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_approximation_theorem'><i>any</i></Link> relationship.</li>
            <hr className = 'w-4/5 rounded-2xl border-black border-1 m-5' />
            <li>In addition to these weights, developers often add a bias to their dense layers.</li>
            <li>Biases are like the 'b' term in 'y = mx + b'; they are a vector of trainable weights that get tacked onto the output of the weighted sum process.</li>
            <li>Biases add a lot of flexibility to the dense layer while usually consisting of much less trainable weights than its main process; hence, they're almost always used.</li>
            <hr className = 'w-4/5 rounded-2xl border-black border-1 m-5' />
            <li>Dense layers, though designed for 1-D inputs, can actually take in an input of any dimension</li>
            <li>Say that our input is made up of 'K' feature vectors of size 'F'. In this case, a dense layer will apply the same weighing process to each feature vector, outputting 'K' output vectors of size 'U'.</li>
